# Welcome to Open Source Show & Tell!

**Open Source Show and Tell** is an event for anyone and everyone who is interested in open source projects. We want this to be an inclusive event that's all about sharing, learning, and getting involved in open source projects.

We hope that this creates an environment where you can meet some like-minded people, but also want to keep it fun and stress-free. To that end, we ask that recruiting not be part of the event.

[On the site](http://opensourceshowandtell.github.io/), you'll find resources for running your own **Open Source Show & Tell**!

In keeping with the spirit of the event, this site is open source and we welcome pull requests! :D
