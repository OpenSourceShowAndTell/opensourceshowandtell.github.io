<p>TL;DR. Open Source Show and Tell is an event for anyone and everyone who is interested in Open Souce projects. We want this to be an inclusive event thats all about sharing and learning about Open Source project and how to get involved in them. We also hope that this creates an environment where you can meet some like minded people, but also want to keep it fun and stress free so we ask that recruiting not be part of the event.</p>

<p>In keeping with the spirit of the event, this site is open source and we welsome pull requests :D</p>

<p><b>Step one: Pick a date and find a location</b></p>

<p>Tip: Try and partner with a company or two that are very acitve Open Souce contribuitors. This way you will have some great content as a base and will be able to get some help with promotion</p>

<p><b>Step two: Find people to present what they are working on. It could be a personal project or it could be a large scale.</b></p>

<p><b>Step three: Find someone to give a workshop. This is an opportunity for attendies to learn something. It could be setting up local environments to get the ball rolling, contributing to something together, doing pairing sessions, brainstorming new projects... the sky is the limit here, but it's really important that people come out of this smarter about something.</b></p>

<p>Tip: If you followed my first tip this sould be easy. It's almost guaranteed that the company who is involved in Open Source has a workshop pre-fabbed and ready to roll. Setting up a good course can talk tons of work, so if you don't have someone that already has something ready to go, the pair programming option can be a good one.</p>

<p><b>Step four: buy some beer.</b></p>

<p>Tip: programmers will drink cheep beer... but they prefer something tatsy.</p>

<p><b>Step five: Promote... like crazy.</b></p>

<p>Tips: Twitter is where lots of programmers hang out. Tweet. Meetup can be a good resource too, there's lots and lots of programming meetups out there. Eventbrite is a good tool, becuase it links to social media and gives you rough count. Make sure ask other Open Source advocates and companies to help you promote. It can be a really big help to tap other peoples networks.</p>
